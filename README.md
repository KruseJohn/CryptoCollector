# Crypto Collector

#### Crypto Collector uses four coins (crypto currencies) as buttons.  The user clicks each coin to obtain a random number, adding these numbers to try and hit the target number established at the beginning of the game. If they hit the target number exactly, they win.  If they go over the target number, they lose.  Either way, the target number and coins are reset to new random numbers, the tally counter resets to zero, and the user is allowed to resume play.


#### Built With: HTML5, CSS3, Twitter-Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery.
